# Filtering Books in Django REST Framework

This guide explains how to implement filtering for the **Book** model in a Django REST Framework (DRF) project using `django-filters`.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install `django-filters`
To enable filtering in DRF, first install the `django-filter` package:
```bash
pip install django-filter
```

Then, add `'django_filters'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other installed apps...
    'django_filters',
]
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update the `BookListView`
Modify your `views.py` to integrate filtering in the **BookListView**:

```python
from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend  # Import DjangoFilterBackend
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer

class BookListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    """
    View to list all books with filtering support.
    - Users can filter by `title`, `author__name`, and `publication_year`.
    """
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]
    
    # Enable filtering
    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]  
    filterset_fields = ['title', 'author__name', 'publication_year']
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Use Filtering
Users can apply filters using query parameters when making a GET request to the books endpoint:

### üîπ Example Requests
```bash
GET books/?title=The Great Gatsby
GET books/?author__name=J.K. Rowling
GET books/?publication_year=2020
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Summary
- ‚úÖ Installed `django-filters`.
- ‚úÖ Updated `settings.py` to include `'django_filters'`.
- ‚úÖ Enabled filtering in `BookListView` using `DjangoFilterBackend`.
- ‚úÖ Users can now filter books by **title, author name, and publication year** using query parameters.

# Search and Ordering Functionality

## Overview
This API provides search and ordering functionality for retrieving book records. Users can filter books by title or author name, and order them based on title or publication year.

## Features
- **Search**: Users can search for books by `title` or `author name`.
- **Ordering**: Users can order results by `title` or `publication year`, in ascending or descending order.
- **Default Ordering**: Results are sorted by `title` by default.

## Configuration in `views.py`
To enable search and ordering, the following configurations are added to `BookListView`:

```python
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.filters import SearchFilter, OrderingFilter
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer

class BookListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    """
    API view to retrieve a list of books with search and ordering functionality.
    Users can search by title or author name and order results by title or publication year.
    """
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    
    # Enable search and ordering functionality
    filter_backends = [SearchFilter, OrderingFilter]
    search_fields = ["title", "author__name"]  # Search by title and author name
    ordering_fields = ["title", "publication_year"]  # Order by title and publication year
    ordering = ["title"]  # Default ordering by title
```

## How to Use
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Searching
Users can search for books by `title` or `author name` using the `search` query parameter.

**Example: Search by title**
```
http://localhost:8000/books/?search=harry
```

**Example: Search by author name**
```
http://localhost:8000/books/?search=rowling
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ordering
Users can order results by `title` or `publication year` using the `ordering` query parameter.

**Example: Order by title (ascending)**
```
http://localhost:8000/books/?ordering=title
```

**Example: Order by publication year (ascending)**
```
http://localhost:8000/books/?ordering=publication_year
```

**Example: Order by publication year (descending)**
```
http://localhost:8000/books/?ordering=-publication_year
```

üí° **Note:** Prefixing a field with `-` reverses the order (descending).

## Summary
- **Search books** by `title` or `author name` using `?search=your_query`.
- **Sort results** using `?ordering=title` or `?ordering=publication_year`.
- **Reverse sorting** by adding a `-` before the field, e.g., `?ordering=-title`.
